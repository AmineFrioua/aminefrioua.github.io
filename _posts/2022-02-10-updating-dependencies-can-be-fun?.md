Updating dependencies in a big project can be a daunting task, especially if you have many dependencies and haven't updated them in a while. However, with the right mindset and approach, updating dependencies can actually be fun and rewarding.

Recently I had to do this, so i dove rigth into it and here are some tips i can provide from my experience:

1- Create a checklist: Before updating any dependencies, create a checklist of all the dependencies you need to update and the steps required to update them. This will help you stay organized and ensure that you don't miss any dependencies.

2- Set aside dedicated time: Updating dependencies can be time-consuming, so set aside dedicated time to focus on this task. You can also make it more enjoyable by listening to music or a podcast while you work.

3- Celebrate progress: Updating dependencies can be a long process, so celebrate your progress along the way. For example, you can treat yourself to a snack or take a short break after each dependency update.

4- Learn something new: Updating dependencies can also be a great opportunity to learn something new. Take the time to read the release notes and learn about any new features or changes in the updated dependencies.

5- Involve the team: Updating dependencies can be a team effort, so involve your team members in the process. You can assign each team member a set of dependencies to update or hold a mini-hackathon to update dependencies together.

By following these tips, updating dependencies in a big project can be a fun and rewarding experience. Not only will you improve the performance and security of your project, but you'll also learn new skills and strengthen your team's collaboration. So go ahead and update those dependencies â€“ you might be surprised at how fun it can be!
